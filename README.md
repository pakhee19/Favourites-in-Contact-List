## Question: <br>
Give an application and its implementation to demonstrate the implementation of data structure for handling the "Favorite" contact list. <br>

 Approach:
We make use of the priority queue data structure by using the following functionalities:  <br>
Add Contact  <br>
Show Contacts  <br>
Show favourites  <br>
Delect contacts  <br>

  The Java program on compiling gives the output as follows:
  <br>
-----------------------------------

   Contacts     <br>
A : Add Contact   <br>
B : Show Contacts   <br>
C : Show favourites  <br>
D : Delect contacts   <br>
Enter your choice      <br>
------------------------------------

After entering the choice, we can add contacts, see them getting displayed after adding the required contacts in our favourites and delete them by selecting the option choice given.
